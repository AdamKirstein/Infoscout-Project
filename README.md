# Infoscout-Project

# overview 
this is a project I worked on for a company called InfoScout. Their concerns were with granulating their customer segmentation models using a previously unexplored data set comprised of user Facebook data. My team and I sought to devise an algorithm that could be used to cluster the data in order to provide InfoScout with what they needed. The results were spectacular! wWe developed developed diverse clusters that InfoScout can access and easily understand through an interactive app that we built in R shiny.
